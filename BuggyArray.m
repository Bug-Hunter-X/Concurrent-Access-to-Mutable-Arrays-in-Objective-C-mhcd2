In Objective-C, a subtle bug can occur when dealing with mutable arrays and concurrent access.  Consider this scenario: you have a mutable array, and multiple threads are adding or removing objects from it. Without proper synchronization (using locks like `@synchronized` or dispatch semaphores), you risk data corruption or crashes.  A seemingly innocuous operation like `addObject:` might lead to unexpected behavior if called concurrently.
